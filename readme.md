# A simple script I made to download all of beksinski's works, to use them as my background and work on them for fun.

I got the list on this page https://www.wikiart.org/en/zdzislaw-beksinski/all-works#!#filterName:all-paintings-chronologically,resultType:masonry 
And I got the list of links using javascript.
I simply pasted everything in this file. It could have been made automatic, but I did not care enough for it. This works just fine.

Currently, some of the imgs are duplicated and around 48 of them cannot be downloaded.

Feel free to update this script if you ever find it.

## How to run this script ?

Install ruby. I used ruby 3.0 but previous versions should also work.
Simply run the script using `ruby beksinski.rb`. Everything will be downloaded in your "./Pictures/bek" folder.


None of the images you may download using this script are my property. You are not allowed to use this script if you plan on using Beksinski's art for AI generation and model training.
