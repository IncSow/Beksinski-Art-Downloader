A simple script I made to download all of beksinski's works

I got the list on this page https://www.wikiart.org/en/zdzislaw-beksinski/all-works#!#filterName:all-paintings-chronologically,resultType:masonry 
And I got the list of links using javascript.
I simply pasted everything in this file. It could have been made automatic, but I did not care enough for it. This works just fine.

Currently, some of the imgs are duplicated and around 48 of them cannot be downloaded.

Feel free to update this script if you ever find it.






None of the imgs you may download using this script are my property.
